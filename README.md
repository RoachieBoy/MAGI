# M.A.G.I
Mathematical Audio Generation Interface, otherwise known as M.A.G.I is my attempt at creating an Audio Synthesis experience in Unity. 

Currently, the project contains code for a monophonic synthesizer system, which includes a couple of standard effects and some presets that make use of Unity audio filters. This project works in unison with another project of mine `synthesizer_native`, which contains C code for the generation of audio samples. Here is a link to that project: https://github.com/RoachieBoy/synthesizer_native
